I taught students how to program Lego robots, guiding them through coding concepts and problem-solving.
Learned and taught a new programming language to create effective learning materials.
Developed skills in patience, teamwork, mentoring, and self-directed learning.
Created structured, reusable resources that helped students understand robotics and programming concepts.

Also included is the 3D model of the badges I created for the students who attended the club. These were printed in a colour of their choice using my 3D printers with a safety pin added on the back using a 3D pen.
